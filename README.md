# Car Price Prediction app

The end goal of this project is to predict the selling price of the used cars based on other input features.In this , I have used the Random Forest Regressor and the Linear Regression as a comparative analysis for which works better. After testing out the model ,I built a web app on django to mount the trained model.The last step of this project involved heroku deployment via github. This project is an example of the entire Machine Learning lifecycle .
